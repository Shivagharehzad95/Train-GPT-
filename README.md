# Train-GPT-

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

In this notebook, you will:

1. **Load a Text Dataset**  
   - Example: a text corpus like books, articles, or any custom text file.

2. **Prepare Dataset for Autoregression**  
   - Use a **sliding window technique** to create input-output pairs suitable for autoregressive language modeling.  
   - Each sequence of tokens predicts the next token in the sequence.

3. **Train a GPT Model**  
   - Fine-tune or train a GPT-style model (from Hugging Face Transformers) on your dataset.  
   - Customize model parameters such as sequence length, batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs.

4. **Evaluate Model**  
   - Generate text using the trained model.  
   - Observe how the model predicts the next tokens in a sequence.
